<font size=+1><b>Requirements</b></font><br>
<pre><OL>
<LI>A X86(Minimal 386) Linux or minimal win98 OS 
<LI>Freepascal : <a href="http://www.freepascal.org">Freepascal homepage </a>
version 1.0.4 only(version 1.1 has some bugs).
Delphi or Gpc can't compile elaya.
<LI>Gnu ld,as and make (binutils) version &gt= 2.9.5

<a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a> utils can also be used.

Under windows, as and ld are allready included a in freepascal.
These executables can also be used for elaya. The binary windows distrubution
allready contains as and ld  for windows. In de default configuration the
programs should be called asw.exe and ldw.exe
<LI>gnu make version &gt;=3.77 (I don't know if non gnu make will work).
</ol>
<b>note.</b>


Elaya is tested on:

<OL>
<LI>win98 SE
<LI>Linux:

<table>
<tr><td>
Distribution </td><td>:</td><td>Suse 7.0. </td></tr>
<tr><td>kernel version</td><td>:</td><td> 2.2.13</td></tr>
<tr><td>libc</td><td>:</td><td>Glibc 2.1.2</td></tr>
</table>
</ol>
</pre><font size=+1><b>Building the sources</b></font><br>
<pre>For building the compiler and Rtl, just run Make.
First the shell script runsetup or runsetup.bat are automaticly called.
The script does the following:
<ol>
<li>Create all the Makefiles
<li>Creates the destination directory <b>$HOME/bin</b><br>Under windows $HOME can <br>be just '/', in this case $HOME is to the source tree<br> root  directory.
<li>Creates file Values.tpl wich is use by cfgc and make.
</ol>

The destiniation directory in step 2 can be changed in runsetup/runsetup.bat
The variabels used for this are: <b>Dir_Program </b>,<b>Dir_Cpl_Lib</b> and 
<b>Dir_Ela_Rtl</b>. When runsetup or runsetup.bat is changed, the script 
is automaticly run by make.

<b>Windows note:</b>
Make from Mingw or Cywin can be used for compiling the sources. When 
<b>bash.exe</b> can be found in the path,runsetup is started using bash otherwise 
the combination runsetup.bat/command.com is used.

 </pre><font size=+1><b>Running make</b></font><br>
<pre>Just type <b>make all</b> at the root of the source tree.
The possible options are
<table>
<tr> <td>all</td><td>:</td><td>Build everything</td></tr>
<tr> <td>ela</td><td>:</td><td>Build the compiler</td></tr>
<tr> <td>lib</td><td>:</td><td>Build the souces in directory lib(*note) </td><tr>
<tr> <td>rtl</td><td>:</td><td>Build the Rtl</td></tr>
<tr> <td>cfg</td><td>:</td><td>Build Cfg files</td></tr>
<tr> <td>cfgc</td><td>:</td><td>Build the <a href='node204.htm'>Cfgc</a> program</td></tr>
</table>

<font color=red>*Note 1</font> The compiler is beta and under development.
The win32 doesn't support all units wich are available under linux.
For more information <a href='node011.htm'>Features and Limitation</a>
*Note 2
The sources in the 'lib' directory are non elaya specific pascal
sources for the compiler have nothing to do with the Rtl.
All Rtl sources for the use in the Elaya language are in 
<b>[Root]/sources/rtl</b></pre><font size=+1><b>The configuration file.</b></font><br>
<pre><b>The creation of the file during make</b>
During make of this elaya package 2 configuration files are made.
The files are 'lib.cfg' and 'ela.cfg'. The 'lib.cfg' is for compiling the RTL
units and 'ela.cfg' is for compiler a program or a unit.
For creating these files, a program 'cfgc' is used. This program is part
of the elaya compiler package and is build during the make process. The
sources are located in 'lib/tools/cfgc'. 
This program uses elaya/Values.tpl and ela.tpl/lib.tpl for input file.
For more information on the 'cfgc' program <a href='node204.htm'>here</a>
</pre><font size=+1><b>Cross compiler</b></font><br>
<pre>Elaya can compile to all platforms from all supported platform (that is I386 win32
and i386 linux).
It is theoraticly possible to compile to linux platform under win32.
The only missing part is the configuration files.
The build/setup system can create configuration files for:
<UL>
<LI>win32 target under win32
<LI>Linux target under linux
<LI>win32 target under linux
</ul>
For linux target under win32 the config/make file must be setup manual.

For win32 target support under linux the following steps are neccesary:
* Install a ld/as version wich compiles to win32
* Change in setup.sh the value for Can_Cross_Compile too 'y'
* Fill in Dir_Win32_As and Dir_Win32_ld  to the path of the win32 assembler and 
  linker.
* When running make the win32 rtl should be automaticly be created.
* For win32 support the compiler binary doesn't need to be recompiled, only
  the configuration files must be changed.

ela -t win32 somefile.ela    => compiles too win32 console
ela -t gui32 somefile.ela    => compiles too win32 gui.

The program created by the compiler can run under wine.

</pre><font size=+1><b>Problems</b></font><br>
<pre><UL>
<LI> All *.pas and *.ela sources must be in lowercase. When make fails
with for example with a message that it can't find a rule too build *.pas,
pleas change case with rename *.PAS *.pas.
<LI>Under win32  sometime the linker fails with "some.obj: file not recognised: 
file truncated" or "some.obj: file format not...." and no executable is produced.
The cause of this error is unkown. When the produced *.obj file is removed
the compiler and linker works fine.
</UL></pre><font size=+1><b>Binary RPM release for i386</b></font><br>
<pre>This release contains the following:<UL><LI> The compiler 'ela' and 'cfgc', placed in /usr/bin
<LI> ela.cfg also placed in /usr/bin 
(oke should be in /etc)
<LI> libraries , placed in /usr/lib/elaya
<LI> Documentation , placed in /usr/doc/elaya
</ul>

Not futher setup is necessary after rpm --install</pre><font size=+1><b>Win32 binary release (>=win98 SE)</b></font><br>
<pre>Just unzip the file and everything should work directly.</pre><br>
